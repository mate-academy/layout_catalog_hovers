> Follow [this instructions](https://github.com/mate-academy/layout_task-guideline#how-to-solve-the-layout-tasks-on-github)

## The task

- Make all the changes smooth on hover
- Smoothly (during 300ms) increase the card by 20 percent on hover (neighboring cards **should not be** affected)
- Smoothly (during 300ms) change card title text color to `#34568b`
  - `:hover` should be applied only to the card, do not add it to the title directly
- Smoothly (during 300ms) change navigation link text color to `#00acdc`

## Requirements:
- write styles in `src/styles/main.scss`
- use SCSS in this task

## Common mistakes
- **IMPORTANT** Save and push your changes to GitHub manually after `deploy`
- Do not use tabs. Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Don't use repeated styles.
